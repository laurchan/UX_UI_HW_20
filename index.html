        <h2>Nonprofit Organization<br>Website Redesign</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
        <p>This project is a collaboration of three including myself. We worked together to redesign a website for the <strong>Georgian Triangle Humane Society (GTHS)</strong>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to finding loving homes for animals in need. Our team recognized the significant value of supporting its mission to reduce the number of homeless pets in the community.</p>

        <strong>The Problem</strong>
        <p>Users have difficulty navigating the GTHS website, primarily due to its <strong>lack of organization</strong> and <strong>outdated appearance.</strong>  Additionally, finding the adoption form poses a challenge for users as its location on the website is unclear.</p>
        <br>

        <strong>The Solution</strong>
        <p>Our redesigned website has improvements in organization, appearance, and enhancing overall usability. We implemented clearer navigation structures, legible fonts, and a consistent colour scheme, ensuring an <strong>efficient</strong> adoption process for</p>

        <h2>Interactive Analysis & User Research</h2>
        <p>We started the project by analyzing the existing website. By conducting a heuristic evaluation, we <strong>identified the problems</strong>  with their current UI and navigation.</p>
        <p>We noticed that a big <strong>weakness</strong> of their website was their <strong>clarity.</strong> </p>
        <br>
        <img src="images/image 16.png">
        <p>They have wrongly sized images and text that blend in with the background due to low contrast. This causes readability issues for the users.</p>
        <img src="images/image 17.png">
        <p>The images and text are far too small, causing a lack of visual impact. They should both be nice and clear as they are the defining reason for why a user would want to click on the profile.</p>
        <img src="images/image 18.png">
        <p>The text for the pet info is too small. The buttons on the very left of the page used to see more pictures of the pet is a poor design choice as some of our users struggled to find it during the user tests. The overall pet description also lacks margins making it hard for users to read and scan it.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>After conducting the initial analysis, my group and I conducted research through <strong>user interviews.</strong> We came up with <strong>two objectives</strong>  and wrote a few questions for each. This is the plan we followed in order to get more insight on our users' relationship with animals and their experience with the adoption process.</p>
        <img src="images/objectives 1.png">
        <p>Each group member did a 30-minute one-on-one interview.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some of the interview notes that our team organized into an <strong>affinity diagram.</strong></p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="images/image 19.png">
                <p>Findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We found that most of our users grew up with animals due to their parents owning pets</li>
                    <li>Due to those living situations, the majority of users end up learning about pet care and adoption from their parents and close relatives</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We found that some of our users struggled during the adoption process because their application got denied</li>
                    <li>A user identified a pain point stating that there was a dog that he was interested in adopting but they got adopted a few hours after he put in his application</li>

        <h3>Meet Isabelle!</h3>
        <p>After completing all of our research, we created a <strong>user persona</strong> who embodied all of the notes and feedback that we received from our users bsed on the interviews.</p>

        <h2>Identifying The Problem</h2>

        <h3>Prototype Iterations</h3>
        <p>Based on the user tests that we conducted, we found that a lot of the users were <strong>confused</strong> by our <strong>button placements</strong> and choice of <strong>colour.</strong></p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This project was a very long but fun experience and over the course of three weeks, I got to improve my leadership and collaboration skills.</p>
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>I learned that I should not hold back on asking questions if I am unsure about something. There is always more to learn and no one should be ashamed of making mistakes.</p>   
        <h3>What I Can Improve On</h3>
        <p>I would like to be able to split my time up more efficiently. As a UI designer who cares very much about producing high quality work, I often find myself spending too long trying to perfect the wireframes and prototype. Instead of trying to perfect the design, I should dedicate my time elsewhere and leave the iterations to be done after conducting user tests.</p>
        <h3>Future Opportunities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue to develop more in-depth pet profiles and help users filter to the right pet that will be a perfect match for their home</li>
            <li>Implement notification alerts to update users on their adoption process keeping users informed and not anxious about when the adoption will be finalized</li>
            <li>Improve the resources and guides that GTHS has on their website to help users with their many needs after the adoption process</li>
        </ul>
